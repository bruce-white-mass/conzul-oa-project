The genome of the tomato biotrophic fungal pathogen Cladosporium fulvum contains a predicted gene cluster (CfPKS1, CfPRF1, CfRDT1 and CfTSF1) that is syntenic with the characterized elsinochrome toxin gene cluster in the citrus pathogen Elsinoe fawcettii. However, a previous phylogenetic analysis suggested that CfPks1 might instead be involved in pigment production. Here, we report the characterization of the CfPKS1 gene cluster to resolve this ambiguity. Activation of the regulator CfTSF1 specifically induced the expression of CfPKS1 and CfRDT1, but not of CfPRF1. These co-regulated genes that define the CfPKS1 gene cluster are orthologous to genes involved in 1,3-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) melanin biosynthesis in other fungi. Heterologous expression of CfPKS1 in Aspergillus oryzae yielded 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene, a typical precursor of DHN melanin. Delta cfpks1 deletion mutants showed similar altered pigmentation to wild type treated with DHN melanin inhibitors. These mutants remained virulent on tomato, showing this gene cluster is not involved in pathogenicity. Altogether, our results showed that the CfPKS1 gene cluster is involved in the production of DHN melanin and suggests that elsinochrome production in E. fawcettii likely involves another gene cluster.","[Griffiths, Scott A.; Collemare, Jerome] Westerdijk Fungal Biodivers Inst, Fungal Nat Prod, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Griffiths, Scott A.; Overdijk, Elysa J.

Despite the role that HPV plays in an estimated 5% of all cancers and the evolving role of HPV vaccination and testing in protecting the public against these cancers, preliminary research in New Zealand health professionals suggest knowledge about HPV may not be sufficient. Methods A total of 230 practice nurses, smear takers and other clinical and laboratory staff who attended a range of training events completed a cross-sectional survey between April 2016 and July 2017. The survey explored four broad areas: demographics and level of experience, HPV knowledge (general HPV knowledge, HPV triage and test of cure (TOC) knowledge and HPV vaccine knowledge), attitudes towards the HPV vaccine and self-perceived adequacy of HPV knowledge. Results The mean score on the general HPV knowledge questions was 13.2 out of 15, with only 25.2% of respondents scoring 100%. In response to an additional question, 12.7% thought (or were unsure) that HPV causes HIV/AIDS. The mean score on the HPV Triage and TOC knowledge questions was 7.4 out of 10, with only 9.1% scoring 100%. The mean score on the HPV vaccine knowledge questions was 6.0 out of 7 and 44.3% scored 100%. Only 63.7% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that they were adequately informed about HPV, although 73.3% agreed or strongly agreed that they could confidently answer HPV-related questions asked by patients. Multivariate analyses revealed that knowledge in each domain predicted confidence in responding to patient questions. Furthermore, the number of years since training predicted both HPV knowledge and Triage and TOC knowledge. Discussion Although overall level of knowledge was adequate, there were significant gaps in knowledge, particularly about the role of HPV testing in the New Zealand National Cervical Screening Programme. More education is required to ensure that misinformation and stigma do not inadvertently result from interactions between health professionals and the public.","[Sherman, Susan M.] Keele Univ, Sch Psychol, Keele, Staffs, England; [Bartholomew, Karen] Waitemata Dist Hlth Board DHB, Auckland, New Zealand; [Bartholomew, Karen] Auckland DHB, Auckland, New Zealand; [Denison, Hayley J.; Douwes, Jeroen] Massey Univ, Ctr Publ Hlth Res, Wellington, New Zealand; [Patel, Hersha; Moss, Esther L.] Univ Hosp Leicester, Dept Gynaecol, Leicester, Leics, England; [Moss, Esther L.] Univ Leicester, Leicester Canc Res Ctr, Leicester, Leics, England; [Bromhead, Collette] Massey Univ, Sch Hlth Sci, Wellington, New Zealand","Bromhead, C (reprint author), Massey Univ, Sch Hlth Sci, Wellington, New Zealand.",C.Bromhead@massey.ac.nz,"Bromhead, Collette/L-9372-2019","Bromhead, Collette/0000-0002-2890-2191; Sherman, Susan/0000-0001-6708-3398",,,,32,6,6,6,18,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,Dec-31,2018,13,12,,,,,,,e0197648,10.1371/journal.pone.0197648,,,16,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,HG0IO,WOS:000454627200001,30596646,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,27/05/2020

However, managing image borders is generally considered more complex than it is with the more commonly used direct-form structure. This paper explores border handling for transpose-form filters, and proposes two novel mechanisms: transformation coalescing, and combination chain modification. For linear filters, coefficient coalescing can effectively exploit the digital signal processing blocks, resulting in the smallest resources requirements. Combination chain modification requires similar resources to direct-form border handling. It is demonstrated that the combination chain multiplexing can be split into two stages, consisting of a combination network followed by the transpose-form combination chain. The resulting transpose-form border handling networks are of similar complexity to the direct-form networks, enabling the transpose-form filter structure to be used where required. The transpose form is also significantly faster, being automatically pipelined by the filter structure. Of the border extension methods, zero-extension requires the least resources.","[Bailey, Donald G.; Ambikumar, Anoop S.] Massey Univ, Sch Engn & Adv Technol, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand","Bailey, DG (reprint author), Massey Univ, Sch Engn & Adv Technol, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand.",D.G.Bailey@massey.ac.nz; A.Ambikumar@massey.ac.nz,,"Bailey, Donald/0000-0002-1025-3680",,,,17,1,1,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2313-433X,,J IMAGING,J.

It, however, has not been documented as to the extent that inbreeding impacts sperm cell characteristics especially after cells have undergone cryopreservation. In the present study, therefore, there was evaluation of sperm motion and size characteristics from two inbred lines and non inbred Hereford bulls using Computer Assisted Sperm Analysis (CASA). Pre-frozen semen samples were obtained from Line 1, Prospector, and a non-inbred Hereford bulls. Average inbreeding of each group was 27%, 45%, and 0%, for Line 1, Prospector, and non-inbred groups, respectively. For each bull, two straws (0.5 ml) were evaluated, within each straw two slides with ten fields per slide analyzed with the CASA. Cells were analyzed by mixed model analysis using a model that contained line as fixed effect and individual bull, straw, slide, and fields are random effects. No significant differences between lines of bulls were found for motility or progressive motility. For the head elongation (ELON), and head area (AREA) significant differences existed between lines. Mean separation indicated that Line 1 group had a larger head area and the heads were not as elongated as the Prospector and non-inbred group cells. The lack of significant differences for motility and progressive motility across lines was surprising and indicates there was no inbreeding depression for post-thaw semen characteristics. One explanation for this could be that indirect selection pressure was placed on these characteristics as inbreeding was increased.","[Tseveenjav, B.; Garrick, D.
